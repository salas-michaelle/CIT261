    <p>If you want to tag a video that is on your computer you would do so in the following format. <b><i>(Note that this video will not load or be viewed because it is an example and I do not have this video on my computer)</b></i></p>
 
    <p><video src="nameofvideo.mp4" controls></video></p>
 
    <p>This an example of HTML5 Tag for Audio. It is very similar to video, except that it needs to be in an audio format such as mp3, wav, ogg.</p>
    
    
    <p><audio src="meow_mix.mp3" controls></audio></p>
