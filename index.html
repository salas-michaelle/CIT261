<p>This is an example of HTML5 Tag for Video. I chose to do it by sharing a youtube video.</p>

<p>If you want to tag a video that is on your computer you would do so in the following format. <b><i>(Note that this video will not load or be viewed because it is an example and I do not have this video on my computer)</b></i></p>

  <p>

    <video src=" nameofvideo.mp4" controls></video>

  </p>

This an example of HTML5 Tag for Audio. It is very similar to video, except that it needs to be in an audio format such as mp3, wav, ogg. <b><i>(Note: since I am on my work computer I cannot have a working audio file, if you would like to see a demo of it playing please let me know and I can show it later on tonight.)</i></b>

<audio src="meow_mix.mp3" controls>

</audio>
